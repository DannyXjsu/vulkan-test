# vulkan-test
Trying to learn Vulkan

I've followed Brendan Galea's tutorial for this

## Building | Linux only
Althought it is possible and maybe simple to compile to Windows and others, I don't feel like making it compatible, at least not right now
### Compile
Just run make

> beware that running ./VulkanTest from the root project directory will result in a crash because it tries to find the shaders folder
